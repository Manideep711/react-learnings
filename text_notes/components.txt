-conditional rendering-

Yes, the syntax {isVisible && <p>Hello, World!</p>} is a common and clean way to conditionally render elements in React. Here's a quick explanation:

{isVisible && <p>Hello, World!</p>}: This uses JavaScript's logical && operator. If isVisible is true, the expression after && (<p>Hello, World!</p>) will be rendered. If isVisible is false, nothing will be rendered.
